This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the future performance of S&P 500 stocks using a hybrid approach that combines fundamental analysis and time series data. The model leverages an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction of fundamental features and an LSTM network to capture temporal dependencies in historical stock prices. The primary objective was to classify stocks into categories such as "Strong Buy," "Buy," "Hold," "Sell," and "Strong Sell" based on predicted future performance. Despite limitations in the dataset and challenges in accurately classifying certain stock categories, the model demonstrated strong performance in identifying "Strong Sell" stocks, providing potential value as a supplementary tool for decision-making in stock trading. 

Included in this repository is a report that evaluates the performance of the mechanism, please read for more details.
